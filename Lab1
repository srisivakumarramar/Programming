# How use Operator in easy method using in python

## The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
## The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

## decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall *= .9

## add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume += rainfall

## increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
## into the reservoir in the days following the storm
reservoir_volume *= 1.05

## decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume *= 0.95

## subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
## that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5 

## print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)
